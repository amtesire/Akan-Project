        <h1>Akan Name</h1>
    <br>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
      <br>This application will help us know the day of the birth and the name you would be called if you were born in Ghana.
    <br>If you submit the application it will dislay your akan name depending on the day of your birth.</p>
